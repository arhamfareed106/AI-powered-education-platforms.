### Development Setup

#### Backend
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

#### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
